<p>
Consider a spinning disk that hovers above a flat surface; see Figure [Figure needed].
The distance between the surface and disk is very small. 
Furthermore, to maintain a minimum height and to prevent the disc from touching the surface,
it is attached in the center. The rest of the disc can move freely. 
To create lubrication effects, a network of air-supply and extraction holes is present in the flat surface.
Careful balancing of air supply and extraction ensures that the disc can hover very closely to the surface without any contact,
even though the disc tends to bend downwards near the edges due to gravitational forces.
</p>

<p>
The air circulation under the disc yields a thin film that acts as lubrication to the spinning disc (air bearing). 
The pressure distribution in the thin film is mathematically described by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_equation">Reynolds equation</a>.
The derivation of Reynolds equation from the Navier-Stokes equation can be found in text books on tribology, e.g., [citation needed].
Due to the pressure distribution, forces act on the disc which subsequently yield deformations. 
The mathematical description of these deformations are givenby the Navier-Cauchy (or elastostatic) equations. 
The pressure forces on and, hence, deformations of the disc will change the gap between disc and surface, which result in a change of pressure. 
We now have a coupled problem between pressure and gap height.

<h4>Pressure driven deformation of a disc</h4>
<p>
To present the coupled problem that describes the pressure distribution in and thickness of a thin film, we use Reynolds' equation as a starting point:
``ρh' - ∇∙(αρh^3∇ p) + \tfrac{1}{2}∇∙(ρχh) - ρχ∙∇ h = s, ``
where α=1/12υ, χ the velocity of the disc, h the gap height, ρ the fluid density, (∙)' the time derivative, and s a source term associated with air supply and extraction.
The presented Reynolds equation neglected any velocity in gap-height direction.
Further, observe that the Reynolds equation in non-linear in gap height, and recall that the gap-height essentially also depends on pressure. 
To close our system we require another equation, notably, the elasto-static equations that relate stress to deformations:
``div(σ)(p) = ρg``
For a derivation on how to obtain displacements from the elasto-static equations see <a href="nutils.org/2014/03/06/orthotropic.html">orthotropic</a>
Henceforth we shall only consider steady-state solutions.
</p>

<h4>Linearized Reynolds equation</h4>
<p>
To solve the non-linear steady Reynolds-equation we first linearize around an initial estimate `h_0, p_0` and substitute `h=h_0+w` and ` p=p_0+δp`.
After tedious steps and reorganizing terms this leads to:
``\begin{multline} 
-\left( ∇(αρh_0^3)∙∇p + αρh_0^3 ∇^2p + ∇∙(3αρh_0^2w ∇p_0) \right) + \tfrac{1}{2}∇∙(ρχw) + ρχ∙∇w \\
= s - \tfrac{1}{2}∇∙(ρχh_0) - ρχ∙∇ h_0\end{multline}``
Note that, for compatibility reasons with the elasto-static equations, the linearized Reynolds equation solves for total pressure `p` and not its perturbation. 
Note further that this is not the case for gap height, since the elasto-static equations solve for the displacement `w` as well.

Reynolds:
Multiplying by a test function `q`, integration over a domain `Ω⊂\mathbb{R}^2` and several integration-by-parts:
``\begin{multline} 
\int_Ω q_{,i} (αρh_0^3)_{,i} p + q(αρh_0^3)_{,ii} p + (qαρh_0^3)_{,i}p_{,i} + q_{,i}(3αρh_0^2w)_{,i} p + \\
+ q(3αρh_0^2w)_{,ii} p + (3qαρh_0^2w)_{,i}p_{,i}+ \tfrac{1}{2} q(ρχ_iw)_{,i} + qρχ_iw_{,i} + \\
- \int_{∂Ω} qp(αρh_0^3)_{,i}n_i + q(αρh_0^3)p_{,i}n_i + qp_0(3αρh_0^2w)_{,i}n_i + 3qαρh_0^2w p_{0,i}n_i =\\ 
=\int_Ω qs - \tfrac{1}{2} (ρχ_ih_0)_{,i} - qρχ_ih_{,i}
\end{multline}``
</p>
<p>
Elasto-static:
Multiplying by a test function `v`, integration over a domain `Ω⊂\mathbb{R}^3` and several integration-by-parts:
``\begin{multline}
\int_Ω v_i σ_{ij,j} = \int_Ω v_i λu_{j,ij} + μ(u_{i,jj}+u_{j,ij}) = \\
=\int_Ω v_{i,j} (λu_{j,i} + μ(u_{i,j}+u_{j,i}) + \int_{∂Ω} v_i(λu_{j,i} + μ(u_{i,j}+u_{j,i}))n_j = \int_Ω ρv_i g_i + \int_{∂Ω} p v_i n_i 
\end{multline}``
where λ and μ are the Lamé constants. Note that the displacement field `u∈\mathbb{R}^3` and that its third component equals the perturbation in gap height, i.e., `u_3=w`.
